This is a Java 1.8 Eclipse Project and you just have to copy those folders in your Project and add the img folder as a source folder as well.
Then it should work all fine.

TODO:
   - create Eclipse Project
   - add folders
   - set "img" as a second source folder
   - try to run
   - THERE YOU GO!
